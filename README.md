# Hello World!
This is a basic habit tracking website created for the December 2023 Codedex hackathon even in under 12 hours. Currently, it works by letting the user create dailyt recurring tasks that should save into a browser's memory. As days go by, whether or not the habit was complete will be tracked, and each habit can be displayed by clicking on them.
